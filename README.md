This project, titled "Enhanced Drought Prediction with Wavelet Transform Decomposition and LSTM Model," focuses on building a robust and accurate drought forecasting system by combining Wavelet Transform for signal decomposition, LSTM for modeling temporal dependencies, and Gradient Boosting for error correction. Leveraging historical and real-time meteorological and soil data—including parameters like temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil moisture—the model identifies patterns and predicts drought occurrences with high accuracy. The hybrid model outperforms standalone approaches, achieving a significantly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0857. Developed using Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, PyWavelets, and deployed via cloud platforms like AWS/GCP, the system includes modules for data preprocessing, model training, prediction, visualization, and user interaction. Its results support decision-making in agriculture and water resource management, offering a scalable, real-time tool for mitigating drought impacts.
